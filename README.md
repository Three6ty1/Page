# Three6ty1's React website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
[React Helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-helmet) was used to customise the site metadata
[MUI components](https://mui.com/) were used to style various sections of the website
[React scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll) for... scrolling.
